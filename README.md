# ERAv3
This repository concerns the exciting weekly mini-projects of the 8-month-long ERAv3 course offered by [THE SCHOOL OF AI](https://theschoolof.ai/#details) (TSAI). The course syllabus can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/theschoolof.ai/ERA+V3+-+Course+Structure.pdf). Some of my learnings and the assignments are shared in this repositiory.

- **Session 1**: Getting over the fear of building anything! Learn to use LLMs to build simple end-to-end applications, like "Google Chrome Extensions". Check out the [YouTube snippets](./session01-chrome-extension/youtube-snippets-v4/) chrome extension.  

- **Session 2**: Getting over the fear of building anything! Learn to use LLMs to build simple end-to-end applications. Build a basic web-server which runs locally. Check out the [webserver](./session02-web-server-hello-world/), built with FastAPI.
